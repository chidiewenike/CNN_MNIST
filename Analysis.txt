I started by adjusting the batch size of flow, the epochs, and steps per epoch. I noticed that my model was overfitting about 5000 steps per epoch with batch sizes at 128. I reduced the steps per epoch to 1500 and was able to obtain 99.5% validation data. Regarding my CNN hyperparameters, I simply tried different channels, different dropouts, and either no regularizers or mixing regularizers. I noticed that 32 channels for CNN Layer # 1, 64 channels for CNN Layer # 2, and 64 channels for CNN Layer # 3. I also noticed that regularizers caused issues so I refrained from using those. I saw varying dropouts provided decent results. For data augmentation, I simply have a low rate of sheer and zoom to provide variance but not cut off the images completely to avoid confusion. Same applies for the rotation range. Ultimately, I was able to obtain 9950 correct predictions (99.5% accuracy).
